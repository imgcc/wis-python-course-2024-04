Do not comment unnecessarily:

```
exit()  # end the program
```

```
counter = 0


counter += 1 # add 1 to the counter
```

Comment where things are unclear:

```
score = (round(100 * (1 - ((n - 1) / 19)) * (1 / (1 + (0.004 * t)))))
```

Explain "why" not the "what"


* Explain what is recursion (Fibonacci, Factorial)
* Show the problem (e.g. factorial(1000))
* Discuss the problem with recursive calling main - in the number guessing game it is better to have two while loops.

* Read the string from a file.

* Count letters, count words


* Install Jupyter notebook, show hello world example with it. Show `input`.
