### Participation in the lectures

There is no requirement to participate in the lectures. You will be able to watch the videos later. However, it is recommended to participate as that gives you an opportunity to ask questions.

### Timestamps

Each video will be around 1 hour long. In order to make it easier to access the specific topics I would like to add timestamps to each video. A timestamp looks like this:

```
00:00 Start
01:30 Installation
```

Meaning at 1 minute 30 seconds I started to talk about Installation.

I'll need volunteers to prepare these timestamps for each video on the day after the lecture.
You basically need to watch the video and write down all the points where you think you or someone else would like to jump to. You can see such timestamps in the comments of many YouTube videos.
We will have an [issue](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-course-2024-04/issues) where you'll be able to volunteer.

### Assignments

There will be assignments after every lecture. You will submit them via GitHub. I'll explain the details during the lectures.

### Project

Towards the end of the course you'll be asked to do a project.
First you need to submit a proposal for the project and when it is accepted then implement it.
The project should be something that is useful for your studies or at least it is fun for you to make.
Ask in the lab where you work what needs are there that you might implement as your final project.
You can get inspiration from the projects [listed here](https://code-maven.com/programming-bootcamp-for-scientists)
and the [projects of the 2023 autumn semester](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-bootcamp-2023-12).

### Grades

* Each assignment counts as 5% (we will have 10 of them).
* The project proposal is 15%.
* The project is 35%.

* The project is a requirement. Without that you won't get a passing grade.

### Slides

During the course I'll use some of the [slides that can be found here](https://code-maven.com/slides/python/).
These slides are publicly available and will remain on the web site after the course is over.

### Videos in English

There are [recording of this course from 3 years ago](https://code-maven.com/programming-bootcamp-for-scientists).

There are also [recordings from the 2023 autumn semester](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-bootcamp-2023-12).

You can watch those, but be also warned, this semester the order of the material will be different.

There are many more videos in my [English-language YouTube channel](https://code-maven.com/youtube).
You are invited to check them out and to follow the channel.

### Videos in Hebrew

Some of the material is also available in Hebrew. You can find them [on my website](https://he.code-maven.com/)
and in my [Hebrew-language YouTube channel](https://he.code-maven.com/youtube). You are invited to
follow that channel as well.

### Language

The standard language of WIS and of this course is English.

However, when on one-on-one conversions I'd be happy to speak in Hebrew, Hungarian, Spanish, or Ladino.

### Installations

There is no need to install anything up front. We'll do that during the lectures.

### Assignment (day 3)

* Visit the home pages of some of the students. Pick two students you don't know yet and who don't have issues opened yet.
    * Open an issue on their assignment repository. (I think issues are not enabled on the repository use for the GitHub pages, so we need to open the issue in the assignments repository.)
    * Praise the parts you like in the web site.
    * Suggest an improvement to the web site or suggest a topic to cover on the web site more in depth. (e.g. Adam likes traveling, so ask for a few more pictures, or a favorite location.)
    * In the issue mention me using `@szabgab` so I'll be notified.

* When you receive such an issue, please react to it. Once you finished implementing whatever it suggested (if there was anything), then close it.

    * Allow the user to play several games: once one game ends ask her if she wants to play again, generate a new random number and play again.
    * If the user enters "x" any time, exit the program.
    * If the user enters "n" any time, leave the current game and ask if she wants to play a new game?
    * If the user enters "s" any time, show the hidden number (cheating).
    * Move the code in a function called `main` and split up the code into several function that make sense.

Do not comment unnecessarily:

```
exit()  # end the program
```

An example when comments go bad:

```
counter = 0


counter += 2 # add 1 to the counter
```

Comment where things are unclear:

```
score = (round(100 * (1 - ((n - 1) / 19)) * (1 / (1 + (0.004 * t)))))
```

Explain "why" not the "what"

### Assignment (day 4)

Create a folder called `day04` and write a program that given a filename on the command line will print the following:

* How many characters does the file have.
* How many lines are in the file.
* How many words are in the file. (For our purpose you can assume that any two things separated by spaces are separate words.)

### Assignment (day 6)

Create a folder called day6 and in it:

Find an important Excel or CSV file in the lab where you work and write a program that will do some computation on it.
Include a sample of the data file and write a test that will verify the results given that input file.

If you don't work in any lab, ask the other participants of the course for a file. Worst case you can download a file
from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

If the files you have contain data that you don't want to be public, replace the real data with fake values.

I know that "some computation" is rather vague, but that's because in each case something els might make sense.

Calculation might be summing up certain numbers or maybe doing a slightly more complex calculation on the data.
Maybe collecing and listing some values that might be numerical or textual.

Please also add a README.md to the day6 folder explaining in a few words or few sentences what the data is and what kind
of computation you do.

### Assignment (day 7)

Create day07 folder

Write a command line tool that can download data from NCBI. You can download from the nucleotide database
as we did in the lecture, but it would be much more interesting if you used some of the other databases
available on NCBI. e.g.:

```
python ncbi.py  TERM NUMBER
```

Search for the TERM and download up to NUMBER items.Save each item in its own file. Print the names of the files.
Also save the date, the search term, the number asked for and the total number of items found in a csv file. So if you run it twice

```
python ncbi.py  Orchid 3
python ncbi.py  cauliflower 7
```

you'd get something like this:

```
date,term,max,total
2024-05-30 17:20:21,Orchid,3,527341
2024-05-30 18:12:34,cauliflower,7,32781
```

Add a `README.md` that explain what the program does.

## Project proposal

As I explained in the lecture you will have to write a project that is hopefully going to be useful or fun for you.

Size: about 4 times bigger than a weekly assignment.

Create a new git repository and in the `README.md` file describe the project. Add links to explanations and images if necessary.
This is the project proposal and this will also become the user-documentation.

The proposal should include the scientific background of the project and the technical, programming part.

The scientific part will likely include many terms I am not familiar with. Please include links to explanations.
This part should also include the explain about the models and how the data is processed. If you use well-known algorithms then
please link to explanations.

The technical part is mostly "standard", but it is better to be explicit about it. So:
* How to install the dependencies? That should be:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* How to run the tests that come with the program? People should be able to just run `pytest` and that should run the tests.
* What kind of input does the program expect and how to run the program. e.g.:
    * The program will receive the name of the input CSV files on the command line and will print the results to the screen: `python project.py  input-1.csv  input-2.csv`.
    * The program will open a window with windows to fill in the input parameters.  (this can be implemented using Tkinter)

If your project relies on some data (most likely it will), then include some data files in the repository. The actual values in the file can be fake, but the format of the file should be
the same as the file(s) you already have.



Open an issue on our repository with a link to this repo.

### Assignment (day 8)

One of the following two in the `day08` folder:

1. Take the number guessing game and create GUI for it using Tk.
    * Have a button or a menu option to exit the game.
    * Have a button to restart the game - the computer generates a new random number and resets the guess-counter.
    * Have a button that will show the currently hidden value in a pop-out dialog.

2. Create a GUI for the ncbi.py of the previous assignment.
    * Have a box to type in the search term.
    * Another box to type in the number - how many to download.
    * A selector to select the database. (nucleotide, ...?)
    * A selector to select the file-format (GeneBank, FASTA, what else can be there?).
    * A button to "download the data".

* Include a `README.md` in the `day08` folder.
* Include a `requrements.txt` if necessary.

I'd strongly recommend that before you submit the solution to me, show it to one of the other students and let
that person try it.
